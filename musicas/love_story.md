C
We were both young when i first saw you 
F
I close my eyes and the flashback starts 
            Am                    F          G
Im standing there on a balcony of summer air 


C
See the lights, See the party the ball gowns 
  F
I see you make your way through the crowd 
          Am
And say hello 
           F     G
Little did I know 

[Pré-Refrão]
     F                       G
That you were romeo you were throwing pebbles 
       Am                        C
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet 
            F
And i was crying on the staircase 
G                       Am   G/
Begging you please don't go, and i said 

[Refrão1]
C
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone 
G
I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run 
Am
You'll be the prince and i'll be the princess 
F                G              C
Its a love story baby just say yes 

[Verso2]
C
So i sneak out to the garden to see you 
F
We keep quiet because we're dead if they know 
         Am
So close your eyes 
                        G
Escape this town for a little while

[Pré-Refrão]
    F                          G
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter 
         Am                        C
and my daddy said stay away from Juliet 
                F
But you were everything to me and I was
G                       Am   F  G 
begging you please don't go, and I said 

[Refrão2]
 C
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone 
 G
I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run 
 Am
You be the prince i'll be the princess 
 F                G                 C
Its a love story baby just say yes 
  C
Romeo save me, they try to tell me how to feel
  G
This love is difficult, but it's real
  Am
Don’t be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
 F                G 
Its a love story baby just say yes, oh

[Bridge]
                 Am/     
I got tired of waiting, 
F/              C/                   G/
  wondering if you were ever coming around 
                Am/      F/
My faith in you was fading
       C/                          G/
Then i met you on the outskirts of town and i said 
  C
Romeo save me i've been feeling so alone 
   G
I keep waiting for you but you never come 
    Am
Is this in my head, i don't know what to think 
     F                       G
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

[Refrão3]

A

  Bm
