Am              G                 C    C
I was scared of dentists and the dark
Am              G                 C            C  
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
   Am      G                   C    C
Oh all my friends are turning green
            Am         G            C       C
You're the magicians assistant in their dreams

   Am   G   C   C

                  Am
Taken away to the dark side
G               C         C
I wanna be your left hand man
       Am       G                        C
And I love you when you're singin' that song and

G                           C     C
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
Am                  G                C                C
This guy decides to quit his job and head to New York City
      Am       G              C    C
This cowboy's running from himself
Am                G                C    C
She's been living on the highest shelf
