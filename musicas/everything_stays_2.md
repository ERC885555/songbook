[Verso]
Gm7             Cm7
Let's go in the garden
Gm7                             B7
You'll find something waiting

(fingerpicking 2: T1 2-3)

Em                                 C
Right there where you left it
          G          D
Lying upside down

Gm7                     Cm7
When you finally find it
Gm7                         B7
You'll  see how it's faded
       Em                 C
The underside is lighter
                 G          D
When you turn it around

[Refrão]
                   Am                                Em
Everything stays right where you left it
                    D       B7           Em
Everything stays but it still changes
              C
Ever so slightly
Cm           G
Daily and nightly
             D
In little ways
              D#dim    Em*
When everything stays
