G                          D
Green was the color of the grass
                Em                 D
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
  G                   D           Em       D
I used to think I would meet somebody there
G                          D
Teal was the color of your shirt
                 Em                 D
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
   G                D                Em  D
You used to work at to make a little money
 
[Refrão]
D
Time, curious time
           Em
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
           D                Em
Were there clues I didn't see?
D                          Em
 And isn't it just so pretty to think
                D
All along there was some
      Em
Invisible string
             G  D  Em  D
Tying you to me?
G   D   Em  D
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
 
[Verso2]
G                        D
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
        Em              D
On your first trip to l.a.
    G                  D            Em  D
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
G                            D
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
        Em                D
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
    G                      D           Em  D
She said I looked like an American singer

[Bridge]
D
 a string that pulled me
Am              G                   D
 Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Am                     G            D
 Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Am                G
 Chains around my demons
D                 Am
Wool to brave the seasons
    G                D
One single thread of gold
           G    D  Em  D
Tied me to you
 
[Verso3]
G                        D
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
        Em                D
For the boys who broke my heart
G                D          Em   D
Now I send their babies presents
G                         D
Gold was the color of the leaves
                   Em               D
When I showed you around Centennial Park
G                           D              Em  D
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
