[Letra]
[Verso1]  
G                Cmaj7
Let's go in the garden
G                      B7
You'll find something waiting
Em                     C7
Right there where you left it
G            D
lying upside down
G                 Cmaj7
When you finally find it
G                    B7
you'll see how it's faded
Em               C7
The underside is lighter
G                 D
when you turn it around

[Refrão]
Am
Everything stays
                Em
right where you left it
D
Everything stays
B7           Em
But it still changes
G7        Cmaj7
Ever so slightly
C7         G
daily and nightly
           D
In little ways
                 G
when everything stays

[Verso2]
G              Cmaj7
Go down to the ocean
G                   B7
The crystal tide is raising
Em                 C7
The waters' gotten higher
G                   D
as the shore washes out
G                   Cmaj7
Keep your eyes wide open
G                    B7
even when the sun is blazin'
Em                    C7
The moon controls the tide
G                    D
it can cause you to drown

[Refrão]
