F   Eb   G7   C                             C/B  
                   Something in the way she moves
C7                           F
   Attracts me like no other lover
D                D7       G
Something in the way she woos me
  Am                          Am#7
I don't want to leave her now
    Am7                 D7 F   Eb   G7
You know I believe and how
C                          C/B 
Somewhere in her smile she knows
C7                         F
That I don't need no other lover
D                D7             G
Something in her style that shows me
Am                      Am#7
Don't want to leave her now
    Am7                 D7   F   Eb   G7   A
You know I believe and how                        
             Amaj7            F#m   A
You're asking me will my love grow
        D      G       A
I don't know, I don't know
          Amaj7              F#m   A
You stick around, now it may show
        D      G       C
I don't know, I don't know

C                        C/B
Something in the way she knows
C7                      F
And all I have to do is think of her
D                 D7         G
Something in the things she shows me
   Am                         Am#7
I don't want to leave her now
         Am7               D7
You know I believe and how
