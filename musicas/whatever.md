    Here in my mind
B  		        G 
    you know you might find
B 	            G 
    something that you
B                    D                        E
    thought you once knew, but now it's all gone
E   G        A   E
an' now it's no fun
E    G        A    E
yeah now it's all gone
E  G        A   E
oh now it's no fun
