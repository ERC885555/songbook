[Letra]  
[Verso]
                     G                              B
When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eyes
                    C                         Cm
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
                 G                      B
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
             C                          Cm
I wish I was special, you're so fucking special

[Refrão]
G -x3-
          G            B
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         C               Cm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

[Verso]
                   G                      B
I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
                 C                      Cm
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
              G                    B
I want you to notice when I'm not around
                  C                     Cm
You're so xxxxing special, I wish I was special
 
[Refrão]

Oooh, oooh, she's running out the door...
C                      Cm
She's running out, she run, run, run...

You're so xxxxing special, I wish I was special
