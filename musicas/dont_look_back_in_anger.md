C               G           Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E7             F    G
Don't you know you might find
                   C      Am   G
A better place to play
C             G           Am
You said that you'd never been
            E7                  F    G
But all the things that you've seen
            C      Am   G
Slowly fade away
F                Fm             C
So I start a revolution from my bed
           F                 Fm 
'Cause you said the brains I had
           C
Went to my head
F                       Fm            C
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
G         
Stand up beside the fireplace
E7
Take that look from off your face
Am             G             F          G
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Refrão]
    C   G         Am
And so, Sally can wait
     E7            F             G          C
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Am     G          C       G    Am      E7         
               My soul slides away
               F              G            C
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

G   Am   E7   F   G   C   Am   G

[Verso]
C               G              Am
Take me to the place where you go
       E7    F      G                C   Am   G
Where nobody knows if it's night or day            
C                      G           Am
Please don't put your life in the hands
      E7            F   G               C    Am   G
Of a rock 'n' roll band, throw it all away            

F                Fm             C
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
           F                 Fm 
'Cause you said the brains I had
           C
Went to my head
F                       Fm            C
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
G         
Stand up beside the fireplace
E7
Take that look from off your face
Am             G             F          G
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
