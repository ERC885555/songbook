[Introdução]
C  G  Am  F (2X)

[Verso1]
  C                                G
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
 Am                              F
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
     C                            G
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
          Am                       F/
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Interlude]
C  G  Am  F

[Verso2]
         C                        G
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
      Am                          F
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
C                               G
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
     Am                     F
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pré-Refrão]
      C
And I know it's long gone and
     G
That magic's not here no more
      Am                        G
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
F   G   F    G
Oh, oh, oh

[Refrão]
       C                          G
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
    Am                                 F
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
            C
Wind in my hair, I was there
       G               Am   F
I remember it all too well

[Verso3]
      C                          G
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
                 Am                             F
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
         C                                         G
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
    Am                                       F
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
             C
And you were tossing me the car keys
           G                            Am
"screw the patriarchy" keychain on the ground
                        F
We were always skipping town
          C
And I was thinking on the drive down
     G                            Am
Any time now, he's gonna say it's love
                            F
You never called it what it was
             C
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
          G
Check the pulse and come back
                   Am
Swearing it's the same
                           F
After three months in the grave
             C
And then you wondered where it went to
     G
As I reached for you
                    Am
But all I felt was shame
                          F
And you held my lifeless frame

[Pré-Refrão]
      C
And I know it's long gone and
          G
There was nothing else I could do
         Am
And I forget about you long enough
      G                F  G  C  G
To forget why I needed to

[Refrão]

    C
And there we are again
       G
When nobody had to know
    Am
You kept me like a secret
      F
But I kept you like an oath
            C
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
        G               Am  F
To remember it all too well, yeah

Instrumental: C  G  Am  F  G  G

[Bridge]
                  C
Well maybe we got lost in translation
        G
Maybe I asked for too much
               Am
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
         F
'Til you tore it all up
             C
Running scared, I was there
           G        Am   F
I remember it all too well
        C
And you call me up again
         G
Just to break me like a promise
   Am                         F
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
          C                        G
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
                      Am        F
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verso4]
          C
They say "All's well that ends well"
    G                         Am
But I'm in a new hell every time
           F
You double-cross my mind
            C                     G
You said if we had been closer in age
                         Am
Maybe it would have been fine
                 F
And that made me want to die
     C
The idea you had of me, who was she?
  G                         Am
A never-needy, ever lovely jewel
                        F
Whose shine reflects on you
    C
Not weeping in a party bathroom
     G
Some actress asking me what happened
Am
You
                      F
That's what happened: you
         C                          G
You, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Am                                 F
Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show
            C
But then he watched me watch the front door
           G
all night, willing you to come
              Am
And he said, "it's supposed to be fun…
F
Turning 21"

[Interlude]
C  G  Am  F

[Verso5]
C                            G
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
            Am                            F
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
      C                                    G
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
        Am                        F
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
        C                           G
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
            Am                            F
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
              C
You can't get rid of it
                G            Am      F
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Refrão]

[Pós-Refrão]
            C
Wind in my hair, you were there
         G
You remember it all
           Am
Down the stairs, you were there
      F
You remember it all
         C/
It was rare, I was there
       G/            Am/     F/
I remember it all too well

[Verso6]
                        C
And I was never good at telling jokes
         Am
But the punchline goes:
           F                       G
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
               C                  Am
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
       F                       G
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
            C                       Am
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
       F                               G
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
              F              F
Cause in this city's barren cold
                       G             G
I still remember the first fall of snow
                           F
And how it glistened as it fell
    F               C       Am
I remember it all too well

       F                              G
Just between us did the love affair maim you
      C    Am
All too well
       F                     G
Just between us, do you remember it
      C    Am
All too well
       F                G            C
Just between us, I remember it all too well

[Outro]
C                      Am
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
F                         G
  Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
C                         Am
  Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
F                       G
  It was rare, you remember it -all too well- (3X)
