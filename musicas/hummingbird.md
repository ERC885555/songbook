[Letra]
[Verso1]
C            E7        Am               F
People dont sing about days that didn't happen and
C           E7       G                 C
People dont cry for tears that weren't shed
             E7            Am          F       C
Time doesnt stop when you close your eyes and your 
       E7             G                    Am        F
Big ol clock will keep on ticking until it dies


[Refrão]
G                          Am      F
Can you hear the hum of the hummingbird
       G                              Am             F
Can you smell the breeze carrying the leaves that it lured
        C            E7              Am       F
Can you cry for your mother and your father too
          C          E7            Am     G        C
Can you breathe..  until.. there's no air left in you

[Verso2]
              E7      Am          F          C
What if there were no wings on a butterfly and
           E7        G        C
What if we walked a thousand days
                  E7          Am      F        C
How long would it take if we all held hands and
         E7             G            Am          F
How many miles could we go before our heads lay down

[Refrão]

[Bridge]
Am            F                     G                 C
No ones going home tonight without a heartache and the moonlight
Am             F                G                C      G            Am
Keep on moving on until there's nothing else to move on to and we're gone

[Refrão]
