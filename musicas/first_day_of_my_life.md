C               E7              Am
   This is the first day of my life
F               G                C
   Swear I was born right in the doorway
C                    E7                        Am
   I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
                  D7               G    G7
They're spreading blankets on the beach
C                E7                Am
   Yours is the first face that I saw
F               G              C
   Think I was blind before I met you
C                           E7                        Am
   Now I don't know where I am, don't know where I've been
            D7              G    G7
But I know where I want to go

        C/        G/      Am/
So I thought I'd let you know
       F                 G
That these things take forever
   C/      E/    Am/
I especially am slow
    Dm
But I realized how I need you and 
                           C     E7    Am    Dm    Fm
I wondered if I could come home 

[Verso2]
C                  E7                Am
   I remember the time you drove all night 
F          G              C
   Just to meet me in the morning 
C                    E7                           Am
   I thought it was strange, you said everything changed 
            D7                   G    G7
You felt as if you'd just woke up 

And you said,
C                E7              Am
   "This is the first day of my life.
F                     G            C
   I'm glad I didn't die before I met you.
C                  E7                  Am
   But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you,
       D7           G      G7
And I'd probably be happy."
            C/  G/      Am/   
So if you wanna be with me 
       F                      G
With these things there's no telling 
            C/     E/       Am/
We'll just have to wait and see
                   Dm
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck 
                               C  E7  Am
than waiting to win the lottery 
          Dm
Besides, maybe this time its different,
                                C  E7  Am
I mean I really think you like me
