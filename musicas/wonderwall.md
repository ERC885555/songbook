[Introdução]
Em G D A (D D DU)

[Verso1]
Em        G 
 Today is gonna be the day
             D                      A     
That they're gonna throw it back to you,
Em           G
 By now you should of somehow
    D                   A     
Realised what you gotta do.
Em                   G       D               A     
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          D     G    D    A        
About you now.

Em            G 
Back beat, the word is on the street
           D                    A     
That the fire in your heart is out,
Em               G
I'm sure you've heard it all before,
         D                   A        
But you never really had a doubt.
Em                   G       D               A     
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          D     G    D    A        
About you now.

[Bridge]
    C             D                   Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding,
    C                   D                 Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding,
C              D                   G       D      C    
There are many things that I would like to say to you
      A          A     
But I don't know how.

[Refrão]
        C    Em    G    
Because maybe,
       Em           C       Em         G 
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    Em    C      Em   G 
And after all,
          Em   C      Em  G
You're my wonderwall.

[Verso2]

[Refrão] 2x

[Outro]
        C    Em    G
I said maybe,
       Em            C       Em        G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
       Em            C       Em        G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
       Em            C       Em        G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
