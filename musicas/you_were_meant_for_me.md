[Verso]
Cadd9                  Em7
I hear the clock, it's six A.M
C                 Em
I feel so far from where I've been
Cadd9                   Em7
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
  C                   D
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
Cadd9                      Em7
I break the yolks I make a smiley face
C                     Em
I kinda like it in my brand new place
         Cadd9
Wipe the spots off of the mirror
               Em7
Don't leave my keys in the door
   C
I never put wet towels
       D
On the floor anymore 'cause

[Refrão]
C            D        G    D           Em
Dreams last so long, even after you're gone
C          D                  G    D       Em
I know that you love me, and soon you will see
          C                    
You were meant for me
    D               Em
And I was meant for you

[Verso]
Cadd9                      Em7
I called my mamma, she was out for a walk
    C                                    
Consoled a cup of coffee
       Em
But it didn't wanna talk
Cadd9                       Em7
Picked up the paper, it was more bad news
      C                             
More hearts being broken
     D
More people being used
Cadd9                 Em7
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
C                     Em
I saw a movie it just wasn't the same
       Cadd9           Em7             C
'Cause it was happy oh, I was sad and  
                    D
It made me miss you, oh so bad 'cause

[Refrão]

[Verso]
  C                        D
I go about my business, I'm doing fine
         G             D    
Besides what would I say
     Em
If I had you on the line?
C                  D
Same old story, not much to say
Em
   Hearts are broken, every day

Cadd9   Em7   C   Em

Cadd9                      Em7
I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
C                         Em
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
Cadd9           Em7
Pick a book up, turn the sheets down
  C                      D
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Cadd9             Em7
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
C                         Em
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead, I
Cadd9                    Em7
Try and tell myself it'll all be alright
C                       D
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause

[Refrão]
