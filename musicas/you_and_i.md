[Letra]
[Verso1]
C  
Don't you worry there my honey  
F  
We might not have any money  
Am                                F  
But we've got our love to pay the bills  
  
C  
Maybe I think you're cute and funny  
F                             Am  
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do  
                             F  
With you, If you know what I mean   

[Refrão]
      C                E7              F  
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes  
                C  
in the South of France  
          C                  E7  
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters  
    F                 G  
And teach them how to dance  
          C                  E7  
Let's get rich and build our house on a mountain  
       F                   D  
Making everybody look like ants  
            C              G          C  
From way up there, you and I, you and I  

[Verso2]
C  
Well you might be a bit confused  
F  
And you might be a little bit bruised  
Am                                F  
But baby how we spoon like no one else  
  
C  
So I will help you read those books  
F  
If you will soothe my worried looks  
Am                                  F  
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf  

[Refrão]
