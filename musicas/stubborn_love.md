[Verso]
       F                  Am
She'll lie and steal and cheat
    F                C
And beg you from her knees
F                   Am    G      C
Make you think she means it this time
      F               Am
She'll tear a hole in you
    F               C
The one you can't repair
    F                Am      G       C
But I still love her, I don't really care.

[Refrão]
F                C     Am   G        F
   When we were young, oooh we did enough
            C       Am      G         F
When it got cold, oooooooo we bundled up
            C      Am      G            C
I can't be told, aaaaaaaah it can't be done

[Verso]
    F               Am
It's better to feel pain
    F            C
Than nothing at all
   F           Am        G     C
The opposite of love's indifference
   F             Am
So pay attention now
   F                C
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
    F             Am       G       C
And I won't leave until you come downstairs
             F/    C/           G/   Am/    G
So keep your head up, keep your love
          F/    C/    G/   Am    G
keep your head up, my love
          F    C     G     Am    G
keep your head up, my love
F    C    G    Am
head up, love
F                 Am
I don't blame you dear
F               C
Running like you did all these years
F              Am       G      C
I would do the same you best believe
       F                  Am
And the highway signs say we're close
     F                C
But I don't read those things anymore
  F             Am  G    C
I never trusted my own eyes

[Refrão]

[Verso]
             F/    C/           G/   Am/    G
So keep your head up, keep your love
          F/    C/    G/   Am    G
keep your head up, my love
          F    C     G     Am    G
keep your head up, my love
F    C    G    Am
head up, love
