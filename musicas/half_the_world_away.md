[Letra]
[Verso1] 
C                 F
I would like to leave this city
C                      F
 This old town don't smell too pretty and
C      G        Am
I can feel the warning signs
D                  F
Running around my mind
C          F
And when I leave this island
C                        F
I'll book myself into a soul asylum
C             G        Am
'Cause I can feel the warning signs
D                   F
Running around my mind,

[Refrão]
Am        C
Here I go
           E7                       Am 
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
    F                      D             G   G7
My body feels young but my mind is very old
Am              C
So what do you say?
           E7                          Am
You can't give me the dreams that are mine 
anyway
        F                   Fm
You're half the world away, Half the world away
C        G      Am
Half the world away
           D                           F
I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down

[Verso2]
C           F
And when I leave this planet
     C                   F
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
C      G        Am
I can feel the warning signs
D                 F
Running around my mind
C               F
And if I could leave this spirit
      C                   F
I'll find me a hole and I'll live in it and
C        G       Am
  I can feel the warning signs
D                   F
Running around my mind,

[Refrão]
